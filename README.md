# tttrevamped
This is the beloved TTT game mode with a few modifications. Me and a small team will be working on this on an off making updates 
and changes. This is for server side only.
I started this project to convert TFA weapons to TTT. 
When that didnt work I decided to recode the game mode a bit to make it run.
The current changes made at the moment are basically deleting a line of coding thats unneccasary.
We are working on making this ttt have fixed hitboxes and more.
This was made for the DemonicGamers TTT server originally
I have decided to release this for people who want some weapons that are currently incompatable for TTT
But I dont plan on stopping there
